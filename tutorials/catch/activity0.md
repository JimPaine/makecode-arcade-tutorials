# MakeCode Arcade - Catch Game (6 - 8 year olds)

## MakeCode Arcade - Catch Game (6 - 8 year olds) @showdialog

Today we will be building a simple game to catch a **nice** item and avoid a **bad** item.

While we build our game we will learn about **events** and **handlers**

So remember to ask questions and have loads of fun.

Lets get coding

Check the **hints** by clicking on the bulb at the bottom!

## What is coding

There are lots of different ways to code, but the two things we will use to make our game today are **events** and **handlers**

**Discussion**

What are these?

Talk them through with your teacher.

```
Events - Something that happens like a button press or when a player catches an item.
Handler - The code used to handle the event i.e. move the player when the button is pressed or increase the score if the player catches an item.
```

## On start

Our first event ``||loops:On Start||`` which happens when our game starts.

**Discussion**

What might we want to do when the game starts?

```
Setup the game!

- Creating our level
- Adding a player
- Adding controls
```

## Adding a background

Select ``||scene:Scene||``

Then drag ``||scene:set background image to []||`` inside the ``||loops:on start||`` block.

Now we can create our background. So click the little grey box.

Click **Gallery** and pick a picture, even take a few minutes to change it!

```blocks
scene.setBackgroundImage(img``)
```

## Congratulations @showdialog

That is the first but very important step. I hope you all love your backgrounds and are ready to carry on coding!
